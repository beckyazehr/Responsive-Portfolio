# Responsive-Portfolio

Description

Create a template for a responsive portfolio from scratch that adapts to different viewport sizes using Bootstrap CSS.  The portfolio includes an About Me, Portfolio, and Contact pages.  This gives a good overview of a person's background as well as a way to reach out with any questions/comments.

Usage

Web pages need to be adaptive because there are many different devices that people use to view web pages: such as laptops, iPads, and smart phones.  It is important to have adaptability built in because users will be less likely to visit your site if they cannot view it with the device of their choosing.  This portfolio was setup using CSS from Bootstrap, as well as grid box rows and columns.
